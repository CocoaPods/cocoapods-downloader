## Install

```
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods-downloader
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cocoapods-downloader'

target_path = './Downloads/MyDownload'
options = { :git => 'example.com' }
downloader = Pod::Downloaders.for_target(target_path, options)
downloader.cache_root = '~/Library/Caches/APPNAME'
downloader.max_cache_size = 500
downloader.download
downloader.checkout_options #=> { :git => 'example.com', :commit => 'd7f410490dabf7a6bde665ba22da102c3acf1bd9' }
```

The downloader class supports the following option keys:

- git: commit, tag, branch, submodules
- hg: revision
- bzr: revision, tag
- svn: revision, tag, folder
- http: type

The downloader also provides hooks which allow to customize its output or the way in which the commands are executed

```ruby
require 'cocoapods-downloader'

module Pod
  module Downloader
    class Base

      override_api do
        def self.execute_command(executable, command, raise_on_failure = false)
          puts "Will download"
          super
        end

        def self.ui_action(ui_message)
          puts ui_message.green
          yield
        end
      end

    end
  end
end
```
